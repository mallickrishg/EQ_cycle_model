# EQ_cycle_model
This repo contains a number of scripts used to simulate frictional earthquake cycles.
The main goal is to nucleate spontaneous transients on a velocity strengthening fault using imposed negative stress steps.

Files named DRIVER_xxx.m are scripts in which I run loops to simulate earthquake cycles over a systematic variation in some parameter and export a downsampled version of the evolution as a mat file
while the EQcycles_xxx.m files are self-contained scripts that run and visualize a rate-state simulation
